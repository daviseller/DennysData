## Not Completed
*All planned tasks completed*

## Decisions Made
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Skip cache for today's games | Ensures live game data is always fresh |
| Sort live games by period desc, time asc | Games further along appear first |
| Combined view with team column | Easier to compare players across teams |
| Hide DNP players | Cleaner table, focus on active players |
