# Session #3 Log

**Date:** 2026-01-30
**Plan:** app-setup

## Objective
Build the day picker and games list components with live API integration.

## Completed
- [x] DayPicker.svelte - date navigation with arrows
- [x] GameCard.svelte - team colors, scores, LED status indicators
- [x] GamesList.svelte - loading/error/empty states
- [x] Wire up home page to live API
- [x] Responsive layout (mobile-first grid)
- [x] Fix timezone handling for scheduled games

## Decisions Made
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Arena theme as default | User preference for light theme |
| Parse `status` field for game time | API returns full datetime in status for scheduled games |
| Team color stripe on cards | Visual team identification without being too prominent |

## Files Created
- `src/lib/components/DayPicker.svelte`

## Files Modified

## Notes for Next Session

- Phase 4: Build game detail page with player stats table
- Consider adding calendar picker for jumping to specific dates (optional)
