# Session #9 Log

**Date:** 2026-01-31
**Plan:** app-setup

## Objective
Housekeeping and UX polish - statusline configuration, skeleton loaders, and career stats fixes.

## Completed
- [x] Updated global statusline to show workflow plan between folder and branch
- [x] Removed local statusLine overrides from all projects (DennysData, port-manager, arium, HolmesWestern, PowerGridMonitor)
- [x] Added .claude/.recovery/ to gitignore across multiple projects
- [x] Added skeleton loader for game log tab
- [x] Made game log scroll height responsive (calc(100vh - 320px))
- [x] Added career-scroll class for career stats table (same responsive behavior)
- [x] Fixed 2015 limit on career stats - now uses player's actual draft year
- [x] Cleared stale player season stats cache for players with incomplete history

## Not Completed
- [ ] Proactive backfill of missing player seasons (cleared cache instead - will fetch on demand)

## Decisions Made
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Clear cache instead of backfill | Simpler, spreads API load, data fetches on first view |
| Use calc(100vh - 320px) for scroll | Responsive to viewport, 320px accounts for header/tabs |
| Global statusline in ~/.claude | One config for all projects |

## Files Modified
- src/lib/components/PlayerPanel.svelte (skeleton + scroll fixes)
- src/routes/api/player/[id]/+server.ts (removed 2015 limit)
- .gitignore (recovery folder, nul file)
- .claude/settings.local.json (removed statusLine override)

## Commits
- 50cb863: Use global statusline config and update status_line.py
- d98feaf: Gitignore .claude/.recovery/ and add session logs
- 20fe98f: Gitignore Windows nul reserved name
- ecd6afb: Add skeleton loader for game log tab
- c729c9c: Make game log scroll height responsive
- 50754b9: Fix career stats to show full history from draft year

## Notes for Next Session
- Player cache was cleared; first load of each player will fetch full history
- API has data back to 1946, but detailed stats from 1996+
- Skeleton loaders now exist for player panel and game log
